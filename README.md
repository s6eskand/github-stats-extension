# Github User Statistics

A chrome extension that gives users Github statistics when on an individuals Github profile

This was built to easily get user statistics with the click of a button instead of scavenging through their entire github profile, which in some cases can become tedious to find.

Displays statistics such as
- Username
- Bio
- Featured Website
- Followers
- Insights into repositories
- Language breakdown of entire profile (based on main language of each repository)
